Hello!
Thanks for checking out my game.
Watch my video on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0MaVL3PQSM

The goal of the game is to hit the colored notes as they reach your paddle.
The note has to be right below your paddle, so time it carefully!
When the note is below the paddle, press the spacebar to trigger it.
The paddle has to be the same color as the note to trigger it.
The A,S,D,F keys change the color of the paddle.
A changes the paddle to red.
S changes the paddle to blue.
D changes the paddle to yellow.
F changes the paddle to green.
Successfully triggering a note causes a unique metalSynth "drum sounding" tone to play
alongside the looping guitar riff and it triggers the arduino to play a buzzer sound
that is unique to each note.
Have fun.
Get to your drumset, you're on!
